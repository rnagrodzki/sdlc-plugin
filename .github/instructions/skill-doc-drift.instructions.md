# skill-doc-drift — Review Instructions

Detect drift between docs/skills/*.md and SKILL.md source of truth

Default severity: medium

## Checklist

- Every step, tool call, and flag documented in `docs/skills/<skill>.md` matches the corresponding `plugins/sdlc/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` — SKILL.md is the source of truth.
- A step renamed, reordered, or removed in SKILL.md is reflected in the matching `docs/skills/*.md` file (or flagged if not).
- A tool name referenced in `docs/skills/*.md` still exists and is still called at the point in SKILL.md the doc describes.
- A field name or flag documented in `docs/skills/*.md` still matches SKILL.md's current dispatch args/output field names.
- New mandatory steps added to SKILL.md (e.g. a new "Step 1: Load State" gate) are not missing from the corresponding `docs/skills/*.md` file.
